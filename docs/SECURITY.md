# Security

Millet should never access the network or execute arbitrary programs. It does perform I/O to read arbitrary user input and overwrite user files (for formatting), but we assume this is intended and desired behavior on the part of the user.

A user could probably "DOS" themselves by asking Millet to analyze a massive or complicated SML file, but we don't really consider this to be a security threat.

That being said, if there is a security issue with Millet, let us know at:

(lowercase first name).z.(lowercase last name)@icloud.com

where:

- first name is "Ariel"
- last name is "Davis"
