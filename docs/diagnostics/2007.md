# 2007

A number (`int`, `word`, or `real`) literal was incomplete. For instance, a word literal that starts with `0w`, but then with no digits following, is incomplete. Or a real literal that has no digits after the decimal point, marked with `.`, or exponent, marked with `e` or `E`.

```sml
val x : word = 0w
(**            ^^ missing digits in number literal *)
val y : real = 1.
(**            ^^ missing digits in number literal *)
val z : real = 1e
(**            ^^ missing digits in number literal *)
```

## To fix

Add some digits to complete the number literal.

```sml
val x : word = 0w123
val y : real = 1.123
val z : real = 1e123
```
