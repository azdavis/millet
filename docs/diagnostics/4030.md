# 4030

There was an `open` at the top level.

```sml
open List
(** + top-level `open` *)
val xs = filter (fn x => x > 10) [1988, 4, 16]
```

This is not allowed when using SML/NJ Compilation Manager (CM), and is generally discouraged anyway.

To fix, contain the scope of the `open`, or use qualified names.

```sml
local
  open List
in
  val xs = filter (fn x => x > 10) [1988, 4, 16]
end

val ys = List.filter (fn x => x < 10) [1988, 4, 16]
```
