# 2002

There was an unclosed comment. This means an open comment delimiter `(*` was not matched by a later close comment delimiter `*)`.

<!-- @ignore can't point at an unclosed comment with a comment -->

```sml
val kujo = 3
(* a comment that doesn't end
val josuke = 4
```

## To fix

Close the comment with `*)`.

Note that comments may be nested.

```sml
val kujo = 3
(* a comment that ends *)
val josuke = 4
```
