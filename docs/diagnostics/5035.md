# 5035

There was a call to `@`, the list append function, with a discouraged argument.

<!-- @ignore this check does not work with mini std basis -->

```sml
fun overlyComplicatedId xs =
  [] @ xs
(** + calling `@` with an empty list *)

fun overlyComplicatedId' xs =
  xs @ []
(** + calling `@` with an empty list *)

fun overlyComplicatedCons x xs =
  [x] @ xs
(** + calling `@` with a singleton list *)
```

These expressions can be simplified:

| Complex    | Simple    |
| ---------- | --------- |
| `[] @ xs`  | `xs`      |
| `xs @ []`  | `xs`      |
| `[x] @ xs` | `x :: xs` |

## To fix

Simplify the expressions. See the above table.
