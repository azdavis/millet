Millet couldn't initialize the workspace root.

When the Millet language server starts up, the client. i.e. the editor, e.g. VS Code, sends the server an initialization message containing a file URL of the currently open folder, if there is one. This is the workspace root URL.

Millet will attempt to parse this URL into a real directory and process the files inside it. If parsing the URL or opening the directory fails, Millet may emit this error.

## To fix

Inspect the workspace root URL/underlying error message for more details.
