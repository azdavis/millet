# 5009

A real literal was used as a pattern.

<!-- @limit first -->

```sml
fun f (x : real) : int =
  case x of
    1.2 => 3
(** ^^^ real literal used as a pattern *)
  | _ => 4
```

## To fix

Consider checking that the given real is within some epsilon value of the desired real.

```sml
val eps = 0.01

fun f (x : real) : int =
  if Real.abs (x - 1.2) <= eps then
    3
  else
    4
```

Usage of `Real.==` to check for equality between reals is discouraged, due to [limitations](https://0.30000000000000004.com) around representing floating-point (aka, `real`) numbers on most architectures.
