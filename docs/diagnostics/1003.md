# 1003

There were multiple group files.

A group file is one of:

- A SML/NJ Compilation Manager (`.cm`) file.
- A ML Basis (`.mlb`) file.

Millet uses group files to know what source files (aka SML files) to analyze, and in what order.

In the absence of a `millet.toml` config file, Millet looks for **exactly one** group contained **directly** in the root directory (i.e. the directory onto which editor is opened).

If Millet finds **more that one** group file in the root directory, it emits this error.

## To fix

Select which group you want to be the "root" group file with a `millet.toml` [config file][config], contained **directly** in the root directory.

In this example, we have a minimal `millet.toml` that defines the single root group file to be `foo.cm`:

```toml
version = 1
workspace.root = "foo.cm"
```
