# 1003

There were multiple "group files" in the root directory for the workspace.

Group files are SML/NJ Compilation Manager (`.cm`) or ML Basis (`.mlb`) files.

Given a workspace directory, Millet will look for group files directly in that directory. (By "directly", we mean not in sub-directories.)

If exactly one such group file is found, it is treated as the "root" group file. But if more than one was found, Millet emits this error, and requires that you choose which group file should be the root.

To fix, select which group you want to be the root group file with a `millet.toml` [config file][config], like this:

```toml
version = 1
workspace.root = "foo.cm"
```
