# 4018

There were multiple type annotations on a single overall pattern.

```sml
fun add ((x : int, y : int) : int * int) = x + y
(**      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ multiple types on one pattern *)
```

This error will occur in situations like this:

```sml
val inc =
  fn (x : int) : int => x + 1
(**  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ multiple types on one pattern *)
```

This may look like it is annotating both the input and output types of this `fn` as `int`, but actually it is annotating the input as `int` twice, redundantly.

Indeed, the below similar code triggers this error, as well as another error that `bool` and `int` are incompatible types. This gives a clue as to what is happening: we are actually trying to annotate `x` as both `bool` and `int`.

```sml
val greaterThanFive =
  fn (x : int) : bool => x > 5
(**  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ multiple types on one pattern *)
```

## To fix

Use at most one type annotation per pattern.

In the first example, either of the following would work:

```sml
fun addAnnotateEach (x : int, y : int) = x + y
fun addAnnotatePair ((x, y) : int * int) = x + y
```

For the `fn` examples, it may work to:

- Annotate the type elsewhere, e.g. with a `val` annotation:

  ```sml
  val inc : int -> int = fn x => x + 1
  ```

- Annotate the body of the function:

  ```sml
  val inc = fn (x : int) => (x + 1) : int
  ```

- Skip annotating the return type:

  ```sml
  val inc = fn (x : int) => x + 1
  ```
