# 5007

**NOTE**: This diagnostic is no longer emitted.

A function application expression was encountered, but the function expression did not have a function type.

<!-- @ignore no longer emitted -->

```sml
val _ = "foo" 3
(**     ^^^^^ expected a function type, found string *)
```

In this example, we attempt to treat the string `"foo"` as a function and apply it to the argument `3`.

This error is a special case of 5006, specialized for the common case of function application.

## To fix

Only apply functions to arguments.
