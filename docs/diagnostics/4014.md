# 4014

There were unnecessary parentheses around something.

```sml
val n = (3)
(**     ^^^ unnecessary parentheses *)
fun inc (x) = x + 1
(**     ^^^ unnecessary parentheses *)
type t = (int)
(**      ^^^^^ unnecessary parentheses *)
```

Many things are "atomic", meaning they do not need parentheses around them to override precedence.

| Example         | Atomic? |
| --------------- | ------- |
| `false`         | Yes     |
| `(1, "hi")`     | Yes     |
| `[1, 3]`        | Yes     |
| `1 + 2`         | No      |
| `print "hi"`    | No      |
| `fn x => x + 1` | No      |

Note that e.g. `op +` is technically atomic, but this error is not issued for parentheses around it, because using parentheses around usages of `op` is somewhat idiomatic.

## To fix

Remove the parentheses.

```sml
val n = 3
fun inc x = x + 1
type t = int
```
