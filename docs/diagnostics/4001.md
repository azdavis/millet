# 4001

In a `fun` binding with multiple cases, the cases did not all name the same function.

```sml
fun jonathan 1 = 2
  | dio _ = 3
(** ^^^ expected a function clause for `jonathan`, found one for `dio` *)
```

To fix, use a consistent name for the function.

```sml
fun jonathan 1 = 2
  | jonathan _ = 3
```
