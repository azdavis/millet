# 5999

There was an occurrence of an unsupported SML construct.

```sml
abstype t = T with val _ = 3 end
(** + unsupported: `abstype` declarations *)
```

At time of writing, Millet does not support `abstype` declarations.

To fix, avoid such constructs. `abstype` is often avoided in modern SML, replaced with a combination of `datatype`, `structure`, and `signature`.
