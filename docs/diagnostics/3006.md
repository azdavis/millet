# 3006

The parser expected something, but it didn't find it. For example, in this case, the parser expected a name after the `structure` keyword, but found the `val` keyword instead.

```sml
structure val platinum = 3
(**       ^^^ expected a name *)
```

This is probably the most common kind of parse error.

One bit of advice is this: Since the parser tries to continue parsing a file even in the face of errors, it may find further errors after the first one. But these errors may be all ultimately because of that first error. So, try looking at the first error in the file first.
