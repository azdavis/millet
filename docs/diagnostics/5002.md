# 5002

There was a duplicate of something.

This may occur when using `and` to declare many things at once.

```sml
val x = 3
and x = 4
(** ^ duplicate value: `x` *)
```

It may also occur when binding the same name more than once in a pattern.

```sml
fun add (x, x) = x + x
(**         ^ duplicate value: `x` *)
```

To fix, use different names, or avoid `and`. (The latter induces shadowing.)

```sml
val x = 3
val x = 4
```
