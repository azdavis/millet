# 1004

There were no "group files" in the root directory for the workspace.

Group files are SML/NJ Compilation Manager (`.cm`) or ML Basis (`.mlb`) files.

Given a workspace directory, Millet will look for group files directly in that directory. (By "directly", we mean not in sub-directories.)

If exactly one such group file is found, it is treated as the "root" group file. But if zero were found, Millet emits this error.

## To fix

Try any of the following:

### Add a group file

Create a group file in the top-level directory. The simplest group file is a ML Basis file listing all of the SML files in your workspace. For instance, you could create a file `sources.mlb` in your workspace root like this:

```mlb
foo.sml
lib/bar.sml
many/directories/deep/quz.sml
```

That is, each SML file is listed in order, one per line.

### Change the top directory

By opening your editor onto a different directory, Millet will look in that directory instead for group files.

### Use a Millet config file

Create a `millet.toml` file in the top-level directory pointing at a root group file.

For instance, if you have opened your editor to `~/foo`, and you have a group file at `~/foo/bar/quz.mlb`, you can create `~/foo/millet.toml` with the contents:

```toml
version = 1
workspace.root = "bar/quz.mlb"
```
