# 3005

Consecutive infix names with the same fixity, but different associativity, were used without parentheses to disambiguate.

```sml
infix <<
infixr >>
fun a << b = a + b
fun a >> b = a * b
val _ = 1 << 2 >> 3
(**            ^^ consecutive infix names with same fixity but different associativity *)
```

It's not clear if this should be parsed as `(1 << 2) >> 3` or `1 << (2 >> 3)`.

## To fix

Do one of the following:

- Add parentheses to disambiguate.
- Use `op` to disambiguate.
- Use different fixities.
- Use the same associativity.
