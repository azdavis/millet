# 4002

In a `fun` binding with multiple cases, the cases did not all have the same number of patterns.

```sml
fun foo 6 = 8
  | foo x y z = x + y + z
(**     ^^^^^ expected 1 pattern, found 3 *)
```

This error can occur when there were no parentheses around what should have been a single constructor-with-argument pattern:

```sml
datatype nat = Z | S of nat

fun toInt Z = 0
  | toInt S n = 1 + toInt n
(**       ^^^ expected 1 pattern, found 2 *)
```

In this example, `S` and `n` are each treated as separate argument patterns for `toInt`.

## To fix

Use a consistent number of patterns across all cases.

```sml
fun foo 6 = 8
  | foo x = x + 3
```

For constructors with arguments, use parentheses.

```sml
datatype nat = Z | S of nat

fun toInt Z = 0
  | toInt (S n) = 1 + toInt n
```
