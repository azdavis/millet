# 4002

In a `fun` binding with multiple cases, the cases did not all have the same number of patterns.

```sml
fun muska 1 = 2
  | muska x y z = x + y + z
(** ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected 1 pattern, found 3 *)
```

## To fix

Use a consistent number of patterns across all cases.

```sml
fun muska 1 = 2
  | muska x = x + 3
```
