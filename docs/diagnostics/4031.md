# 4031

There was an occurrence of `:>` in a context where only `:` is expected.

```sml
val x :> int = 3
(**   ^^ not allowed here *)
```

`:>` is for opaque ascription, which only applies to structures and signatures in certain contexts. `:` is for both transparent ascription as well as type annotation.

Functor arguments can only be transparently ascribed, and values and patterns can only be annotated with types, not be ascribed opaquely (or transparently, for that matter). Thus, in those contexts, only `:` is appropriate, not `:>`.

## To fix

Use `:` instead.

```sml
val x : int = 3
```
