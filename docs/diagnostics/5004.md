# 5004

Something was not requested by a signature, but was present in the structure that is attempting to ascribe to that signature.

Usually, this is allowed, but it is forbidden for `datatype` declarations.

```sml
structure S
  : sig    datatype d = Pazu          end
  = struct datatype d = Pazu | Sosuke end
(** ^^^^^^ extra value not present in signature: `Sosuke` *)
```

## To fix

Ensure only the requested items are defined.

```sml
structure S
  : sig    datatype d = Pazu end
  = struct datatype d = Pazu end
```
