# 1021

An SML path specified in the Millet config file had an empty component.

SML paths should be a non-empty string of characters separated by `.`, and there should not be nothing between consecutive `.`. So a path like `Foo.Bar..Quz.flub` will trigger this error. The empty path will also trigger this error.

To fix, avoid consecutive `.` or the empty string.
