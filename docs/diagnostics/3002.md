# 3002

A name that was declared infix was used as non-infix without the required preceding `op` keyword.

```sml
val _ = + (2, 3)
(**     ^ infix name used as non-infix without `op` *)
```

## To fix

Use the name infix, or add `op` to temporarily make the name non-infix.

```sml
val _ = 2 + 3
val _ = op+ (2, 3)
```
