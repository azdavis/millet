# 5015

A constructor had no argument in a pattern match, but it was defined to have an argument in the `datatype`.

```sml
datatype d = A | B of int

fun f x =
  case x of
    A => 1
  | B => 2
(** ^ missing argument for constructor pattern *)
```

## To fix

Try one of the following:

- Add an argument to the pattern:

  ```sml
  datatype d = A | B of int

  fun f x =
    case x of
      A => 1
    | B _ => 2
  ```

- Define the constructor to not have an argument:

  ```sml
  datatype d = A | B

  fun f x =
    case x of
      A => 1
    | B => 2
  ```
