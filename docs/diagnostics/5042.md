# 5042

A function literal (lambda) expression of the form `fn x => f x` can be simplified to `f`.

```sml
val xs = List.map (fn n => Int.toString n) [1986, 8, 2]
(**                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ can be simplified *)
```

This is called eta reduction.

## To fix

Replace the expression as suggested.

```sml
val xs = List.map Int.toString [1986, 8, 2]
```
