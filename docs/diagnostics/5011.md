# 5011

A pattern matcher, i.e. a `case` expression, `fn` literal, or sequence of `fun` cases, was not exhaustive.

Suppose we have a pattern matcher on an expression $e$ of type $t$.

If there exists a value $v$ of type $t$, such that there does _not_ exist a pattern in the pattern matcher that matches that value $v$, then this pattern matcher is _not_ exhaustive.

```sml
datatype d = A of string | B of int | C of bool

fun f (x : d) : int =
  case x of
(** + non-exhaustive case: missing `A _` *)
    B y => y
  | C z => if z then 1 else 2
```

In this example, `A "foo"` and `A "bar"` are examples of values not matched by the matcher.

In fact, `A s` for infinitely many strings `s` would not be matched. To communicate this, the error message notes that `A _` is not matched, where the `_` is understood to mean "any value of the appropriate type".

## To fix

Add patterns matching the missing cases.

```sml
datatype d = A of string | B of int | C of bool

fun f (x : d) : int =
  case x of
    A s => String.size s
  | B y => y
  | C z => if z then 1 else 2
```

## A caveat

The definition of "not exhaustive" given above is almost correct, save for complications involving non-constructible types.

For instance, in this example, we define a type `void` which can never be constructed. This is because to construct a `void` we would already need to have a `void` to pass to `Void`, the sole constructor for `void`, but we can't have one.

It would seem that we should be able to match on values of type `void` with the "empty case" since there are no such values. However, the pattern matching exhaustiveness checker is not aware of such subtleties and requires there be a case for the `Void` constructor.

```sml
datatype void = Void of void

fun absurd (Void v : void) : 'a = absurd v
```
