# 5011

A `case` expression (or similar) was not exhaustive.

When we `case` on a value of a given type, we must assume that value can be any possible value of that type.

Thus, if:

- there exists a value of the type being matched, such that
- there does _not_ exist a pattern in the `case` that matches that value,

then the `case` is not exhaustive.

```sml
datatype d = A of string | B of int | C of bool

fun f (x : d) : int =
    case x of
(** ^^^^^^^^^ non-exhaustive case: missing `A _` *)
      B y => y
    | C z => if z then 1 else 2
```

## To fix

Add patterns matching the missing cases. The error message reports examples of patterns not matched.
