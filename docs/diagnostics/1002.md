# 1002

**NOTE:** This error is not currently emitted. It may be in the future.

A path wasn't contained in the root directory.

Millet requires all the files to be analyzed be ultimately contained within a single, "root" directory. Millet thus refuses to analyze files outside this root.

To fix, move the file into the root, or do not reference it.
