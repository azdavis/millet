# 4005

A numeric label (as for a record) was invalid. This can happen when it was non-positive (i.e. negative or zero), or too large.

```sml
val x = { 123456789123456789123456789 = "hi" }
(**       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ invalid numeric label: number too large to fit in target type *)
```

To fix, use small positive numbers for labels.

```sml
val x = { 3 = "hi" }
```
