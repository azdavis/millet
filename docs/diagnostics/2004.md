# 2004

A `string` literal was not closed. String literals start and end with `"`.

<!-- @ignore too hard to point at the end of the file -->

```sml
val greeting = "hello there
(**                        ^ unclosed string literal *)
```

## To fix

Close the string literal with `"`.

```sml
val greeting = "hello there"
```

This error may occur when trying to embed `"` in a string literal. To embed `"` in a string literal, use `\"`.

```sml
val greeting = "he jumped down and said \"hello there\" to the general."
```
