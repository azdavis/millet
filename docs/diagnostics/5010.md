# 5010

A pattern in a `case` expression or similar (like `handle`) was not reachable.

Patterns in a `case` are tried from top to bottom. If a pattern further up the `case` always matches certain values, then the lower pattern will never be reached. Thus, the lower pattern is unreachable.

```sml
fun f x =
  case x of
    1 => 2
  | 1 => 3
(** ^ unreachable pattern *)
  | _ => 4
```

## To fix

Try:

- Making the higher pattern different or more specific, so the lower pattern may be reached.
- Removing the lower pattern.
