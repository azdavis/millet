# 2006

A `char` literal contained more (or less) than 1 byte.

```sml
val tooBig = #"hello there"
(**          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ character literal must have length 1 *)
val tooSmall = #""
(**            ^^^ character literal must have length 1 *)
val nonAscii = #"„ÅÇ"
(**            ^^^^ character literal must have length 1 *)
```

## To fix

Make the character literal 1 byte long, or use a string literal.

```sml
val justRight = #"h"
val greeting = "hello there"
val empty = ""
```
