# 5018

In a `val rec` binding, the expression must be a literal `fn` expression.

```sml
val rec x = x + 3
(** + the expression for a `val rec` was not a `fn` *)
```

It is an error even if the expression does not use the recursive binding.

```sml
val rec x = 3
(** + the expression for a `val rec` was not a `fn` *)
```

It is also an error even if the expression has function type.

```sml
val mkAdd3 = fn () => fn x => x + 3
val rec add3 = mkAdd3 ()
(** + the expression for a `val rec` was not a `fn` *)
```

## To fix

Ensure the expression is a literal `fn` expression.

```sml
val rec add3 = fn n => n + 3
val rec fact = fn n => if n = 0 then 1 else n * fact (n - 1)
```
