# 4025

A name bound in a pattern in a matcher (e.g. `case`) was the same as the name of a `fun` declaration that contained the pattern.

```sml
fun foo x =
  case x of
    0 => 1
  | foo => foo
(** ^^^ name bound in pattern inside a `case` matches name of a `fun` that contains the `case` *)
```

This is at best a possibly confusing case of shadowing.

This warning occurs in the following somewhat common scenario:

<!-- @ignore many errors and warnings, including the one mentioned -->

```sml
fun foo 0 y = y
  | foo 1 y =
      case y of
        0 => 1
      | 2 => 3
      | _ => 4
  | foo x y = x + y
(** ^^^ name bound in pattern inside a `case` matches name of a `fun` that contains the `case` *)
```

This looks like a `fun` with many cases, one of which has an inner `case`. However, most SML parsers (including Millet) attempt to parse the final `foo x y` as part of the `case` instead as part of the `fun`. This leads to confusing errors, often [3001](#3001) and [3002](#3002).

To fix, try one of the following:

- Put parentheses around the inner matcher (i.e. `case`, `fn`, or `handle`).
- Rename the binding to avoid shadowing.

```sml
fun foo 0 y = y
  | foo 1 y =
      (case y of
        0 => 1
      | 2 => 3
      | _ => 4)
  | foo x y = x + y
```
