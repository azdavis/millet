# 1020

A filesystem path had invalid UTF-8.

In general, paths on most modern systems can be almost arbitrary byte sequences, save for treating path separators like `/` specially and disallowing NUL bytes. However, in various places in Millet, we depend on paths being valid UTF-8.

## To fix

Rename the implicated file to a valid UTF-8 filename.
