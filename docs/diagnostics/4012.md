# 4012

An expression was found where a declaration was expected.

In many other programming languages, constructs similar to `if` and `case` (like `switch`) are statements. SML does not have statements, and `if` and `case` are instead expressions.

In e.g. Python, you might write something like this:

```py
def foo(x):
    y = 3
    if x == 4:
        y = 5
    return y + x
```

An attempt to translate this literally into SML will emit an error:

```sml
fun foo x =
  let
    val y = 3
    if x = 4 then y = 5 else ()
(** ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expression not allowed here *)
  in
    y + x
  end
```

Instead, we can define `y` as the result of evaluating an `if` expression.

```sml
fun foo x =
  let
    val y = if x = 4 then 5 else 3
  in
    y + x
  end
```

In fact, you can do this in Python as well.

```py
def foo(x):
    y = 5 if x == 4 else 3
    return y + x
```

This error may also arise when the intent is to generate a side-effect. For instance, in Python, you can write:

```py
def bar(x):
    y = x + 1
    print(y)
    return y
```

Again, in SML, an attempt to translate this literally may result in an invalid program, even when adding the necessary type conversion and newline for SML's `print`:

<!-- @ignore requires the use of semicolons -->

```sml
fun bar x =
  let
    val y = x + 1;
    print (Int.toString y ^ "\n");
(** ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expression not allowed here *)
  in
    y
  end
```

Here, the solution could either be to:

- Use a val binding in the `let ... in`:

  ```sml
  fun bar x =
    let
      val y = x + 1
      val () = print (Int.toString y ^ "\n")
    in
      y
    end
  ```

- Use an expression sequence with `;` in the `in ... end`:

  ```sml
  fun bar x =
    let
      val y = x + 1
    in
      print (Int.toString y ^ "\n");
      y
    end
  ```
