# 5032

A `where type` was invalid.

```sml
signature BAD = sig
(**             + cannot realize type `t` as `int` *)
  type t
end
  where type t = int
  where type t = string
```

This error also arises when using `type a = b` in signatures, because that is syntactic sugar for a usage of `where type`.

```sml
signature BAD = sig
(**             + cannot realize type `t` as `int` *)
  type t = int
end
  where type t = string
```
