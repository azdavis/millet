# 5003

Something was requested by a signature, but not present in the structure that is attempting to ascribe to that signature.

```sml
signature SIG = sig
  val x : int
  val y : string
end

structure Str : SIG = struct
(**                   ^^^^^^ missing value required by signature: `x` *)
  val y = "oops"
end
```

To fix, provide definitions for the missing items.

See also [5034](./5034.md) for a particular case in which this error may confusingly appear.
