# 2001

There was an invalid character in the source file.

<!-- @limit first -->

```sml
val 空条承太郎 = 3
(** ^ invalid source character *)
```

Only certain ASCII characters may appear in names and the like.

## To fix

Use only allowed source characters.

Only ASCII characters, but not all ASCII characters, are allowed.

```sml
val kujoJotaro = 3
```
