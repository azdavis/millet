# 2001

There was an invalid character in the source file.

```sml
val 空条承太郎 = 3
(** ^ invalid source character *)
```

Only certain ASCII characters may appear in names and the like.

To fix, only use allowed source characters. Only ASCII characters (but not all ASCII characters) are allowed.

```sml
val kujoJotaro = 3
```
