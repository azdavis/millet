There was a declaration hole.

```sml
structure S = struct ... end
(**                  ^^^ declaration hole *)
```

Declaration holes are written `...`.

Sometimes `...` is used in declaration position as a placeholder or filler in examples.

## To fix

Replace or remove the hole.

```sml
structure Replaced = struct val x = 3 end
structure Removed = struct end
```
