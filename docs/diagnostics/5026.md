# 5026

There was an expression hole.

```sml
val answer = if ... then "yes" else "no"
(**             ^^^ expression hole with type `bool` *)
```

The error message contains information about the type of the hole given the surrounding context. For instance, in the above example, the hole is reported to have type `bool` because it is being used as the condition to an `if` expression.

Expression holes can either be `...` or `_`.

```sml
fun f x = _ + 5
(**       ^ expression hole with type `int` *)
val ans = f 3
```

## To fix

Replace the hole with a real expression of the correct type.

```sml
val answer = if 3 < 4 then "yes" else "no"
fun f x = x + 5
```
