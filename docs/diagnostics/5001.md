# 5001

A name was referenced, but it was not defined in that scope.

```sml
val bar = foo
(**       ^^^ undefined value: `foo` *)
```

To fix, try any of the following:

- Check that the name is correctly spelled.
- Check the if the name is defined in the current scope unqualified, or if it is in a structure. For instance, `filter` is defined in `structure List`, not at the top level. Some functions like `map` are defined both in `List` and at the top level.
- Check the error message to see what kind of thing was not defined: value, type, structure, etc. These different kinds of items have different namespaces.

  In this example, there is a value named `x` defined, but then we try to use `x` as a type. There is no type `x` defined, so this is invalid.

  ```sml
  val x = 4
  val y : x = 5
  (**     ^ undefined type: `x` *)
  ```

- Check that the name is not explicitly forbidden from being accessed by a signature ascription. Ascribing a structure to a more restrictive signature prohibits accessing the "extra" items inside the structure.

  ```sml
  signature SIG = sig
    val foo : int
  end

  structure Str : SIG = struct
    val foo = 3
    val bar = "hi"
  end

  val s = Str.bar
  (**     ^^^^^^^ undefined value: `bar` *)
  ```
