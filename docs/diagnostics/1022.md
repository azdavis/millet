# 1022

A `Library` CM file had an empty export list.

```
Library is
  a.sml
  b.cm
```

## To fix

Either define exports between `Library` and `is`:

```
Library
  structure A
  signature B
is
  a.sml
  b.cm
```

Or use a `Group`:

```
Group is
  a.sml
  b.cm
```

A `Group` with no listed exports exports everything.
