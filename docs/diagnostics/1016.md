# 1016

There was a `funsig` export kind in a SML/NJ CM file.

Millet does not support `funsig` exports in CM files, nor does support `funsig` in SML source files. This is because `funsig` is not standard SML as defined in its Definition.

## To fix

Avoid using `funsig` in exports and in SML code.
