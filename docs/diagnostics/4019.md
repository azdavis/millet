# 4019

There was a declaration missing its right-hand side.

```sml
val x : int
(** ^^^^^^^ missing right-hand side of declaration *)
```

The above example is valid specification syntax for signatures, but is not a valid declaration.

To fix, provide a right-hand side.

```sml
val x : int = 3
```
