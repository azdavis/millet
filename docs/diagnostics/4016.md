# 4016

There was a `case` expression with only one arm.

```sml
datatype d = D of int
fun toInt x = case x of D y => y
(**           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `case` with only one arm *)
```

- An exhaustive case with only one arm is better expressed as an irrefutable binding, e.g. with `val`.
- A non-exhaustive case with only one arm should be made exhaustive.

## To fix

Rewrite the `case` as something else, or add more arms.

```sml
datatype d = D of int
fun toInt (D y) = y
```
