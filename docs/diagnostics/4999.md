# 4999

There was an occurrence of an unsupported SML construct.

```sml
val x = #[1, 2]
(**     ^^^^^^^ unsupported: vector expressions *)
```

At time of writing, Millet does not support the following constructs:

| Name                         | Example                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Vector expressions           | `val _ = #[1, 2]`         |
| Vector patterns              | `fn #[1, 2] => 3`         |
| Do declarations              | `do print "hello"`        |
| Expression row punning       | `val _ = {a, b}`          |
| `withtype` in specifications | (same as in declarations) |

Note that these constructs are not defined by the Definition, but are somewhat common extensions in implementations like SML/NJ and MLton.

To fix, avoid such constructs.
