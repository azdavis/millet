There was a non-whitespace character in a string continuation.

<!-- @ignore too hard to point at the string continuations across lines -->

```sml
val s =
  "this string is\  not
  \ valid because there\ are
  \ non-whitespace\ characters
  \ in the continuations"
```

String literals permit the sequence `\...\`, where `...` represents 1 or more whitespace characters. The sequence is ignored. We dub such sequences "string continuations", since they are often used to "continue" strings across lines.

## To fix

Ensure the string continuations contain only whitespace.

Millet recognizes all characters defined in the Definition as whitespace, as well as some others, like carriage return (common on Windows).

```sml
val s =
  "this string is\
  \ valid because there are only\
  \ whitespace characters\
  \ in the continuations"
```
