# 5040

There was a declaration with no effect.

If a declaration is known to never introduce any bindings or cause a side effect, then it has no effect.

```sml
val _ = 4
(** + no effect *)
```

## To fix

Cause the declaration to have an effect, or remove it.

```sml
(* has an effect because it adds a binding *)
val a = 4

(* has an effect because it might raise (a side effect) *)
val _ = 123123123 + 456456456

(* has an effect because it prints to stdout (a side effect) *)
val _ = print "hi"

(* has an effect because it adds a binding *)
fun loop () = loop ()

(* has an effect because it loops forever (a side effect) *)
val _ = loop ()
```

Note that the analysis is not sophisticated.

```sml
fun four () = 4

(* won't actually have an effect, but we don't warn for no effect *)
val _ = four ()
```
