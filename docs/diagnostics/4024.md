# 4024

The left-hand side of an `as` pattern was neither a name nor a typed name.

```sml
fun f x =
  case x of
    3 as y => y
(** ^ left-hand side of `as` pattern must be a name *)
  | _ => x
```

The syntax for `as` patterns is `<name> (: <ty>)? as <pat>`.

## To fix

Ensure the left hand side of the `as` is either a name or a typed name.

```sml
fun f x =
  case x of
    y as 3 => y
  | _ => x
```
