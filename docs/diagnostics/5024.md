# 5024

Not all or pattern alternatives bound the same names.

```sml
datatype t = Foo of int | Bar of int

fun toInt (x : t) : int =
  let val (Foo y | Bar _) = x
(**                ^^^^^ `y` was bound in one alternative, but not in another *)
  in y end
```

To fix, ensure all alternatives bind the same names. The types must also match.

```sml
datatype t = Foo of int | Bar of int

fun toInt (x : t) : int =
  let val (Foo y | Bar y) = x
  in y end
```

Note that or patterns are not permitted by the Definition, though they are a common extension, implemented by SML/NJ and MLton.
