# 1017

An export was undefined.

Millet uses either SML/NJ CM files or ML Basis files (aka "group" files) to know what SML source files to analyze, and in what order. Both of these group file types allow for listing "exports", which are generally the names of structures, signatures, or functors.

This error will be emitted when a group file lists an export not defined by the source files.

For instance, given these two files:

```sml
(* a.sml *)
structure Foo = struct end
```

```text
(* sources.mlb *)
local
  a.sml
in
  structure Bar
end
```

Millet will emit this error because `structure Bar` is not defined in `a.sml`.

## To fix

- Define the export in source files.
- Or remove the export in the group file.
