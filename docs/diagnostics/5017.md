# 5017

A type escapes the scope in which it is valid.

Here, the type `d` is only available for the scope of the `let` expression, but the `let` expression would cause a value of type `d` to "escape" the `let` and be bound to `x`, outside the `let`.

```sml
val x =
    let datatype d = D in D end
(** ^^^ type escapes its scope: `d` *)
```

This can also occur for explicit type variables, as in this example:

```sml
fun f b x =
(** + type escapes its scope: `'a` *)
  let
    fun g (y : 'a) = if b then x else y
  in
    ()
  end
```

Here, `x` and `y` are both inferred to have type `'a`. Note that:

- `'a` is implicitly bound at `fun g`.
- `x` is bound before `fun g`.

To fix, try one of the following:

- Extend the scope of the type:

  ```sml
  datatype d = D
  val x = D
  ```

- Do not allow its values to escape its scope:

  ```sml
  val x =
    let
      datatype d = D
    in
      4
    end
  ```

- Remove explicit type variable annotations:

  <!-- @ignore unused value -->

  ```sml
  fun f b x =
    let
      fun g y = if b then x else y
    in
      ()
    end
  ```

- Change where type variables are bound:

  <!-- @ignore unused value -->

  ```sml
  fun 'a f b x =
    let
      fun g (y : 'a) = if b then x else y
    in
      ()
    end
  ```
