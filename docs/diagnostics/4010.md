# 4010

A structure-level declaration, i.e. one that starts with one of:

- `structure`
- `signature`
- `functor`

occurred in a disallowed position, like inside a regular declaration.

```sml
val s =
  let
    structure Integer = Int
(** ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ structure-level declaration not allowed here *)
    val x = 3
  in
    Integer.toString x
  end
```

To fix, move the declaration to an allowed position.

```sml
structure Integer = Int
val s =
  let
    val x = 3
  in
    Integer.toString x
  end
```

This error is also emitted for `include` specifications occurring in declaration position. To fix, move or remove the `include`.
