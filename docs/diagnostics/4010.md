# 4010

A structure-level declaration, i.e. one that starts with one of:

- `structure`
- `signature`
- `functor`

occurred in a disallowed position, like inside a regular declaration.

```sml
val s =
  let
    structure Integer = Int
(** ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ structure-level declaration not allowed here *)
    val x = 3
  in
    Integer.toString x
  end
```

This error is also emitted for `include` specifications occurring in declaration position.

```sml
include LIST
(** + not allowed here *)
```

## To fix

Move the declaration to an allowed position.

```sml
structure Integer = Int
val s =
  let
    val x = 3
  in
    Integer.toString x
  end

signature L = sig
  include LIST
end
```
