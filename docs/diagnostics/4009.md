# 4009

There was an `open` or `include` without operands.

```sml
signature S = sig
  include
(** + requires at least 1 operand *)
end
```

To fix, give them some operands, or delete the empty `open` or `include`.

```sml
signature A = sig
  val x : int
end

signature S = sig
  include A
  val y : string
end
```
