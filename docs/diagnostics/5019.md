# 5019

The wrong number of type arguments was passed to a type-level function.

```sml
type ('a, 'b) pair = 'a * 'b
type nope = int pair
(**         ^^^^^^^^ expected 2 type arguments, found 1 *)
```

`datatype`s, like `'a list`, also define type-level functions.

```sml
val xs : list = []
(**      ^^^^ expected 1 type argument, found 0 *)
```

## To fix

Pass the correct number of type arguments.

```sml
type ('a, 'b) pair = 'a * 'b
type yep = (int, string) pair
val xs : yep list = []
```
