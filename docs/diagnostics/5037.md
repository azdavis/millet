# 5037

A function literal expression ("lambda") was applied to an argument.

```sml
val _ = (fn x => x + 1) 3
(**     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ applying a function literal to an argument *)
```

To fix, "inline" the literal, or use something like `let` or `case`.

```sml
val inlined = 3 + 1

val usingLet =
  let
    val x = 3
  in
    x + 1
  end
```
