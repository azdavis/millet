# 5031

A `sharing type` was invalid.

<!-- @limit first -->

```sml
signature SIG = sig
  type a = int
(**    + cannot share type `a` as `int` *)
  type b = int
  sharing type a = b
end
```

Here, types `a` and `b` are already defined as type aliases, so they cannot be shared with `sharing type`. It is immaterial that `a` and `b` happen to be defined to be the same type.

## To fix

Make sure the types being shared are not already defined.
