# 3003

A fixity declaration was invalid.

This can happen when the fixity is too large.

```sml
infix 123456789123456789 foo
(**   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ invalid fixity: number too large to fit in target type *)
```

## To fix

Only use small-ish fixities.

Fixities larger than 16 are discouraged.

```sml
infix 9 foo
```
