# 5038

There was a usage of the top-level `use` function, which has implementation-defined semantics.

```sml
val () = use "foo.sml"
(**      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `use` ignored *)
val x = Foo.bar + 3
```

This function is provided by some SML implementations, like SML/NJ, but not others, like MLton. When it is provided, its approximate semantics are to "load" the contents of the SML file with the given name, bringing all of its definitions into scope in the file that called `use`.

This is sometimes used for simple multi-file SML projects. However, Millet only supports using "group files", aka ML Basis and SML/NJ CM, to coordinate multi-file SML projects.

## To fix

Use group files to inform Millet about the dependencies between SML files.

If you wish to also compile and run your SML project with group files, you can remove the calls to `use`. If, however, you only want to use group files for Millet, and still want to use `use` when compiling your project, you can ignore this error in your `millet.toml`.
