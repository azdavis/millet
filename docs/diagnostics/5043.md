# 5043

A suspicious pattern match was detected.

Users of SML unfamiliar with the semantics of pattern matching may sometimes try to use pattern matching to check an expression for equality with an existing binding, like this:

```sml
val x = 3

fun check y =
  case y of
    x => x
(** ^ does not check any part of the matched expression for equality *)
  | _ => 2
(** ^ unreachable pattern *)
```

In this example, the pattern `x` unconditionally matches the expression `y` because variable patterns always match. The fact that there is an existing binding `x` with the same type already in scope makes no difference. Pattern matching does not check that `y` is equal to the existing `x`.

Because of this, the next pattern match arm with the pattern `_` is unreachable.

This warning also occurs in similar situations like this:

```sml
datatype d =
  A of int
| B of string

val x = 3

fun check y =
  case y of
    A x => x
(** ^^^ does not check any part of the matched expression for equality *)
  | _ => 2
```

But note in this case, the second match arm is reachable.

## To fix

- To check that two values are equal in SML, you may be able to use `=`, the polymorphic equality function.
- To use pattern matching as normal but avoid this warning, rename the bindings.
