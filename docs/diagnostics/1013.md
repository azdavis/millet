# 1013

In a SML/NJ CM file, there was a `source(path)` export whose path was not in the list of members (the bit after the `is`).

```sml-nj-cm
Library
  source(foo.sml)
is
  bar.sml
```

## To fix

Include the path in the list of members.

```sml-nj-cm
Library
  source(foo.sml)
is
  foo.sml
  bar.sml
```
