# 5023

A record type couldn't be fully resolved, due to the use of a `...` pattern row with insufficient surrounding context.

```sml
fun getX {x, ...} = x
(** + cannot resolve `...` in record type: `{ x : _, ... }` *)
```

SML lacks row polymorphism, so the above example function does not typecheck.

This error may arise when using `#` selectors.

```sml
fun addFooBar x = #foo x + #bar x
(** + cannot resolve `...` in record type: `{ bar : <num>, foo : <num>, ... }` *)
```

## To fix

Consider adding a type annotation.

```sml
type t = {x : int, y : bool, z : string}
fun getX ({x, ...} : t) = x
```

An alternative would be to avoid `...` pattern rows altogether.

```sml
fun addFooBar {foo, bar} = foo + bar
```
