# 4003

An integer (`int` or `word`) literal was invalid. This can happen when it is too large.

```sml
val n = 0w123456789123456789123456789
(**     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ invalid literal: number too large to fit in target type *)
```

To fix, use smaller literals.

```sml
val n = 0w123456789
```
