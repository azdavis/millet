# 4023

There was a non-specification declaration in a specification context.

```sml
signature S = sig
  val y : int
  fun inc x = x + 1
(** + non-specification not allowed here *)
end
```

## To fix

Move the declaration out of the signature, or remove it.

```sml
signature S = sig
  val y : int
end

fun inc x = x + 1
```
