A type variable name was incomplete.

```sml
val xs : ' list = []
(**      ^ incomplete type variable *)
```

To be complete, a type variable name must be the following in sequence:

1. One or more ticks: `'`
1. An alphabetic character: `A-Z` or `a-z`
1. Zero or more alphanumeric characters or ticks: `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, or `'`

To fix, use a valid type variable name.

```sml
val xs : 'a list = []
```
