# 5016

An invalid name was used as the left hand side of an `as` pattern.

As-patterns allow binding the entirety of a pattern `p` to a name `n` with the pattern `n as p`. However, the name `n` may not, for instance, already exist as a non-value:

```sml
exception e
fun f x =
  case x of
    e as [_] => 1 :: e
(** ^^^^^^^^ invalid `as` pat name: `e` *)
  | _ => []
```

## To fix

Use a valid name.

```sml
exception e
fun f x =
  case x of
    y as [_] => 1 :: y
  | _ => []
```
