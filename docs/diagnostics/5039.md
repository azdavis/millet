# 5039

An expression that will never `raise` was surrounded with a `handle`. This means none of the arms of the `handle` will be reachable.

```sml
val a = 4 handle Overflow => 5
(**     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ unreachable `handle` *)
```

## To fix

Make the handled expression actually (possibly) raise something, or remove the `handle`.

```sml
val b = (4 + 123123123) handle Overflow => 5
val c = 4
```

Note that the analysis is not sophisticated.

```sml
fun four () = 4

(* won't actually raise, but we don't warn for the unreachable `handle` *)
val _ = four () handle Overflow => 5
```
