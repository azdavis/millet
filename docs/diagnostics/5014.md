# 5014

A constructor had an argument in a pattern match, but it was defined to have no argument in the `datatype`.

```sml
datatype d = A | B of int

fun f x =
  case x of
    A y => y + 1
(** ^^^ unexpected argument for constructor pattern *)
  | B z => z - 1
```

## To fix

Try one of the following:

- Remove the argument from the pattern:

  ```sml
  datatype d = A | B of int

  fun f x =
    case x of
      A => 1
    | B z => z - 1
  ```

- Define the constructor to have an argument:

  ```sml
  datatype d = A of int | B of int

  fun f x =
    case x of
      A y => y + 1
    | B z => z - 1
  ```
