# 4033

There was a `let` expression without declarations in the `let ... in`.

```sml
val x = 4 * let in 2 + 3 end
(**         ^^^ overly complex *)
```

## To fix

Replace the `let` expression with its final expression, possibly wrapped in parentheses if there were multiple expressions in the sequence or if parentheses are otherwise needed for parsing precedence reasons.

```sml
val x = 4 * (2 + 3)
```

Or, add declarations in the `let ... in`.

```sml
val y = 4 * let val z = 2 in z + 3 end
```
