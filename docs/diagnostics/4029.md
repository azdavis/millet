# 4029

There was an occurrence of a disallowed language construct.

The language construct may have been explicitly disallowed in `millet.toml`, or it may have been implicitly disallowed by default (for some Successor ML features).

## To fix

Either allow the thing in `millet.toml`, or remove the occurrence of the thing from the code.

Consult [the manual](/docs/manual.md#language) to see how to edit your `millet.toml` to allow the item.

Some constructs may not be allowable because support for them in Millet is not implemented.
