# 5013

A pattern match treated a value as if it were a pattern.

```sml
structure S = struct
  val x = 3
end

fun f y =
  case y of
    S.x => 1
(** ^^^ value binding used as a pattern *)
  | 4 => 5
  | _ => 6
```

This error is emitted when a path (in this example `S.x`) is encountered, but the path is a value binding, not a constructor.

Only values that are known to be constructors are allowed in patterns. All constructors are values, but not all values are constructors.

In this example, SML does not, for instance, enter the case arm for `1` if `y` is equal to whatever value got bound to `S.x` (in this case `3`).

## To fix

Try one of the following:

- If the value is known to be a particular constructor, use that constructor verbatim in the pattern match.

  ```sml
  fun f y =
    case y of
      3 => 1
    | 4 => 5
    | _ => 6
  ```

- Check for equality another way, for instance with `=`.

  ```sml
  structure S = struct
    val x = 3
  end

  fun f y =
    if y = S.x then
      1
    else if y = 4 then
      5
    else
      6
  ```
