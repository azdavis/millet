# 3001

A name that was not declared infix was used as infix.

```sml
datatype t = C of int * int
fun bad (a C b) = a + b
(**          ^ non-infix name used as infix *)
```

## To fix

Use the name as non-infix, or declare the name as infix.

```sml
datatype t = C of int * int
fun useAsNonInfix (C (a, b)) = a + b
infix C
fun useAsInfix (a C b) = a + b
```
