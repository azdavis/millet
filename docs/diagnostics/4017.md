# 4017

There was an unnecessary semicolon.

```sml
val x = 3;
(**      ^ unnecessary `;` *)
val y = "hi";
(**         ^ unnecessary `;` *)
```

Semicolons are used in a REPL setting to indicate the end of input, but are unnecessary in most cases in source files.

## To fix

Remove the semicolon.

```sml
val x = 3
val y = "hi"
```
