# 4008

There was a bar (aka `|`) before the first:

- Case in a `fun` declaration.
- Case in a `fn`, `case`, or `handle` expression.
- Constructor in a `datatype` declaration or case.

```sml
datatype d =
| Chihiro
(** + preceding `|` *)
| Sheeta
```

## To fix

Remove the first bar.

```sml
datatype d =
  Chihiro
| Sheeta
```
