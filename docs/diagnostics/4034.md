# 4034

There was a `local` declaration without declarations in the `local ... in`.

```sml
local
(** + overly complex *)
in
  val x = 3
  val y = 4
end
```

## To fix

Replace the `local` declaration with only the `in ... end` declarations.

```sml
val x = 3
val y = 4
```

Or, add declarations to the `local ... in`.

```sml
local
  val z = 2
in
  val x = z + 1
  val y = z * z
end
```
